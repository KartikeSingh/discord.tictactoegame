# Installation
```
npm i discord.tictactoe
```

# What is this for?
This package is created for making a Tic-Tac-Toe game for discord bots with Message Components.

# Why?
This package is very easy to use and you can request new updates and stuff simply by messaging me on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/XYnMTQNTFh)

# How?
```js
const ttt = require('discord.tictactoegame');
const tttInstance = new ttt();

/**
 * This method will start a Solo game between The message author and bot, everything is automatic <3
 * @param {Discord.Message} message The message object where the command was used
 * @param {Discord.Client} bot Your client object
 */
tttInstance.solo(message, bot);

/**
 * This method will start a Duo game between The message author and Player 2, everything is automatic <3
 * @param {Discord.Message} message The message object where the command was used
 * @param {Discord.User} player2 The mentioned User / second player. Note it should be a discord user Object not guild member object
 */
tttInstance.duo(message, player2);
```
